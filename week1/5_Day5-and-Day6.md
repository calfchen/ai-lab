# summarize

## Day 5

### Goal 1: Summarize what you learned so far.

- Content-based recommendation by using exact KNN search.
- Content-based recommendation by using approximate KNN search.
- User to User CF
- Item to Item CF
- Matrix Factorization

### Goal 2: Refactor your code so that all five methods above have the same interface and by giving different data sets, results and relevant evaluation metrics can be computed easily.

- Think about how to make improvements?
- Hint: when using the above methods, what information you use?
- What are the information you forget to put into the algorithm?
- Can you make the recommendation results better?

### Goal 3: Brainstorm and come up with your own recommendation algorithm! Google can be very helpful!

- You don’t need to invent a super cool algorithm by yourself. Find a paper that excites you most and go ahead to implement it.
- How to find a paper: Google “X accept papers in Y” where X = {KDD, WSDM, AAAI, IJCAI, SIGIR, WWW} and Y = {2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017}.

## Day 6

- Data profiling on the data you picked on Day 1.
- Play with your refactored, clean recommendation algorithms on your data.
- Implement your own recommendation algorithm or published algorithm and test it on your data.
- Benchmark both the recommendation accuracy and running time.
- Data statistics (feature distributions, etc.)
- Recommendation performance (recall, RMSE, MAE, etc)
- Running time analysis
- Any interesting stuff you find
- Prepare the report to summarize what you learned in this week.
- Submit your report and your code.
